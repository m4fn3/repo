                Note: Only users who read messages after you started using this tweak will be recorded, so it will be empty just after installation but it's normal behavior.<br>

            <h2>Other Features</h2>
            <p>
                You can copy others' used stickers as GIFs to the clipboard. When pasted and sent, they will be displayed like regular stickers with transparency.<br>
