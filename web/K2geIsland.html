            <h2>Customize color & opacity dynamically!</h2>
            <p>
                You can change the color & opacity of Dynamic Island with your preferences.<br> 
                There are 4 coloring options: Static, Dynamic, Random and Custom.<br>
                ・Static : Always use your favorite color for Dynamic Island.<br>
                ・Dynamic : Use the specific color decided by Apple to use as the outline color.<br>

                ・Custom : Use the custom color for each elements (See the list below for the list of supported elements.)<br>
                        You can select the color for each of them in the setting.<br>
                * Supported element types: AirDrop, Bluetooth, Call, Charging, Focus Mode Toggle, Lock, Face ID, Map, Now Playing, Screen Mirroring, Screen Recording, Silent Mode Toggle, Timer, Voice Memo
            </p>
            <h2>Adjust the position & size freely!</h2>
            <p>
                You can adjust the position of Dynamic Island. Moreover, you can resize the Dynamic Island without streching the entire elments!<br>
                With this feature, your elements of Dynamic Island won't be hidden under the notch even if you don't lower the position.<br>

            </p>
            <h2>Fully control apps & type of elements to display!</h2>
            <p>
                You can control whether to allow certain elements (Supported elements are the same as the color customization) to be shown on Dynamic Island.<br>
                Also, you can filter them per app by selecting apps in the setting.
            </p>
            <h2>Beautify the items inside Dynamic Island!</h2>
            <p>
                You can change the opacity & background color of the items. Also, you can modify the corner radius of them so that they look cleaner.<br>
                * Some elements assume that the background color of Dynamic Island is black and use the black color which can't be changed with this as of now.
            </p>
            <h2>More useful options!</h2>
            <p>
                Besides hiding Dynamic Island when they are not in use, you can make them ignore symmetry to save space in status bar.<br>
                Not only that, you can customize outline color and opacity. You can hide the outline if you don't like it of course.
            </p>
