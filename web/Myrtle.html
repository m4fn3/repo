            <h1>Features</h1>
            <h2>Beautiful edge handle</h2>
            <p>
                Always-on overlay handle placed at the left or right edge.<br>
                Vertical pan to move the handle; horizontal edge pan to open the selector.<br>
                Can be hidden from screen recordings and screenshots if you want.<br>
                Automatically avoids the keyboard when it appears to prevent interference with typing.
            </p>
            <h2>Semi-circular app selector</h2>
            <p>
                Configurable favorite slots including apps and actions, plus a “recent apps” expansion.<br>
                Actions include opening a quick app launcher, screen recording, screenshots, opening URLs, triggering shortcuts, triggering Snapper / CopyLog / K2gecamen tweaks, and opening Control Center / Notification Center, etc.<br>
                The center button functions as a special button and has two behavior styles: basic mode / quick mode.<br>
                The center-hold action expands how you interact with the selector.<br>
                Detailed specifications are provided below.<br>
                Show a hover icon preview of apps when selecting them; you can disable it if you want.
            </p>
            <h2>Floating window</h2>
            <p>
                Features two styles of floating windows: one-window mode (recommended) / multi-window mode.<br>
                <br>
                One-window mode is carefully designed to quickly call up a single floating window with a refined user interface.<br>
                Apps inside the floating window can be switched, and support automatic adoption of app rotation (landscape adoption).<br>
                Swipe up and down the handle to snap the floating window to the top-right / top-left corners.<br>
                Supports both portrait and landscape modes, and window size can be adjusted in Settings (dynamic resizing will come in future updates).<br>
                The keyboard can be shown outside the floating window for easier typing, and the keyboard position in landscape mode can be adjusted.<br>
                <br>
                Multi-window mode allows multiple floating windows to be opened simultaneously, each with its own independent controls for moving, resizing, and closing.<br>
                Only multi-window mode requires <a href="https://havoc.app/package/aerial">Aerial by uz.ra</a> (available on the Havoc repo). One-window mode does not need it. <br>
                I'm not responsible for any issues or bugs of the Aerial as to multi-window mode.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>System integrations</h2>
            <p>
                Supports integration with system universal links and notifications.<br>
                You can open universal links, including file sharing and AirDrop, directly in a floating window.<br>
                Notifications can be opened in a floating window as well.<br>
                Quickly open the app that recently sent a notification from the selector instead of the last used app, within a configurable time interval.
            </p>
            <h2>16:9 aspect ratio support</h2>
            <p>
                One-window mode supports a 16:9 aspect ratio for the floating window, making it perfect for saving screen space and watching videos.<br>
                Apps that should always use the 16:9 aspect ratio can be configured in Settings.<br>
                You can also apply the 16:9 aspect ratio automatically when the floating window is snapped to the top corners or when the device is in landscape mode.<br>
                As some apps have layout issues with the 16:9 aspect ratio, you can add exceptions for those apps in Settings.
            </p>
            <h1>Specifications</h1>
            <h2>Center button styles</h2>
            <p>
                basic mode: The center button is a toggle to switch between opening in fullscreen or windowed mode when you select an app (the center icon glyph shows the current state).<br>
                    - Hold and release the center button to open the last windowed app(s) (only when it's in the “opening in window” state).<br>
                <br>
                quick mode: The center button opens the last windowed app(s).<br>
                    - If you select an app, it will open in fullscreen.<br>
                    - If you hold the center button and then select an app, it will open directly in a window.<br>
                <br>
                both modes share the following behaviors:<br>
                    - When you already have app(s) open in a window, selecting an app will open it in a window regardless of state, and the center button becomes a close button for window(s).<br>
                    - When the opened app is snapped to a top corner, selecting an app will open it in fullscreen regardless of state.<br>
                    - Holding and releasing the center close button opens the currently windowed app in fullscreen (one-window only).<br>
                <br>
                When you hold the center button long enough to trigger center-hold actions, haptic feedback will notify you. This threshold time can be adjusted in Selector Settings. I recommend not lowering it until you get used to it, or you may trigger it unintentionally.
            </p>
            <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

            <h1>Changelogs</h1>
            <p>
                v1.1.5: - Fixed the bug that opening windowed app (16:9) in fullscreen broke layouting (regression of v1.1.4) <br>
                - Fixed the small gap in deafult position when swipe down <br>
                v1.1.4: - Added animations when you opened selector / selected apps / triggered center-hold <br>

                - Changed the way to get recent apps to record it manually considering the app opened in window (It still won't show apps opened in window on an app switcher / it excludes apps which are already in the selector) <br>
                - Improved the App Launcher with some optimizations: <br>
                1. More reliably automatically open keyboard <br>

                - Rearranged some preferences in settings <br>
