                Vertical pan to move handle; horizontal edge pan to open selector.

            </p>

                Configurable favorite slots including apps and actions and “recent apps” expansion.

                Center button functions as a special button and have 2 behavior styles: basic mode / quick mode.
                Center hold action will expand the way you interact with the selector.

            </p>
            <h2>floating window</h2>
            <p>
                Features 2 styles of floating window: one-window mode (recommended) / multi-window mode. 

                One-window is carefully designed to quickly call up a single floating window featuring a refined user interface. 
                Apps inside the floating window can be switched, and support automatic adoption for app's rotation (landscape adoption).
                Swipe up and down the handle to snap the floating window to top right / left corners.
                Supports both portrait and landscape modes, and window size can be adjusted within the settings (dynamic resizing will come in future updates).
                Keyboard can be show outside the floating window for easier typing, and keyboard position of landscape mode can be adjusted.

                Multi-window mode allows multiple floating windows to be opened simultaneously, each with its own independent controls for moving, resizing, and closing.
                Only multi-window mode requires Aerial by uz.ra (available on Havoc repo). One-window mode doesn't need it at all.
            </p>
            <h2>system integrations</h2>
            <p>
                Supports integration with system universal links and notifications.
                You can open universal links including file-sharing, AirDrop etc in floating window directly.
                Notifications can be opened in floating window as well.
                Capable of quickly opening the app which recently sent notification from the selector instead of the last used app with in a configurable time interval.
            </p>
            <h2>16:9 aspect ratio support</h2>
            <p>
                One-window mode supports 16:9 aspect ratio for floating window, making it perfect for saving screen space and video watching.
                Apps to always apply 16:9 aspect ratio can be configured in settings.
                Also you can make it to apply 16:9 aspect ratio automatically when the floating-window is snapped to top corners, or when the device is in landscape mode.
                As some apps have layout issues with 16:9 aspect ratio, you can add exceptions for those apps in settings.
            </p>
            <h1>Specifications</h1>
            <h2>Center button styles</h2>
            <p>
                - basic mode: The center button is a toggle to switch between opening in fullscreen or window, when you select app (center icon glyph shows the current state). 
                    - Hold and untap on a center button to open last windowed app(s) (only when it's in the 'opening in window' state).
                - quick mode: The center button is a button to open last windowed app(s).
                    - If you select an app, it will open the app in the fullscreen. 
                    - If you hold on a center button and then select app, it will open the app in window directly.
                - both of them have following abilities: 
                    - When you have already opened app(s) in window, it'll directly open the app in window when you select an app regardless of the state, and the center button will be a button to close window(s). 
                    - When the opened app is snapped to the top corner, it'll directly open the selected app in fullscreen when you select an app regardless of the state. 
                    - Holding and untapping on this center close button will open the currently windowed app in fullscreen (one-window only).
                
                When you hold on the center button enough to trigger the center-hold actions, the haptic feedback will notice you. This threshold time can be adjusted in Selector Settings. I recommend you not to lower it until you get used to it, or you may trigger it unintentionally.
            </p>
